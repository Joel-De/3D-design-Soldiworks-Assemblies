Soldiworks Assemblies & Other fun stuff

Appart from coding I do a TON of 3D printing with my own custom made machine, below are some of my coolest projects:


I built a 3D printer back in grade 9, and have had some pretty bad Z Banding issues with it, unfortunately those are the kinds of issues you get when parts are sourced for cheap, but I recently came accross a pair of slightly damaged linear rails (The endcap was broken), I quickly modeled a piece for that and had the rails back to their original condition. So, I designed the X-Z gantry for my printer completely from scratch to incorporate these rails, and ended up making my printer print on par with 2-3 thousand dollar machines.
Here are a few pictures of what the design looked like.

Speaker:
I've been working on this one since grade 9, I had really bad headphones so I thought it'd be fun to make a pair on my 3D printer and got trapped in the world of audio physics and insanely tight tollerances. This turned into a project that lasted 4 years and counting, I've gotten it to a pretty good spot that I'm proud of but still can improve before I go ahead and put them in an enclosure.

Falcon Heavy Model:

Im a pretty bug space fan so a couple years ago I designed a scale model of the Falcon Heavy in solidworks, and ran some fluid simulations on it just to see what kind aerodynamic features it has, heres a pic of the model
