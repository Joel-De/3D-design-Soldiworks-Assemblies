Soldiworks Assemblies &amp; Other fun stuff

Appart from coding I do a TON of 3D printing with my own custom made machine, below are some of my coolest projects:

Falcon Heavy Model:

Im a pretty bug space fan so a couple years ago I designed a scale model of the Falcon Heavy in solidworks, and ran some fluid simulations on it just to see what kind aerodynamic features it has, heres a pic of the model

Speaker:
I've been working on this one since grade 9, I had really bad headphones so I thought it'd be fun to make a pair on my 3D printer and got trapped in the world of audio physics and insanely tight tollerances. This turned into a project that lasted 4 years and counting, I've gotten it to a pretty good spot that I'm proud of but still can improve before I go ahead and put them in an enclosure.
